## F# programming

I'm only starting to create content here, so for now you won't find much. I'll start with some articles on Elmish.WPF.

[How to create an Elmish.WPF application - part 1](elmish_wpf/get_started.md)

In part 1 I explain how to just get the simplest of demos up and running from scratch, just so that newcomers can get an impression of how things work.

How to create an Elmish.WPF application - part 2 (not yet written)

In part 2 I will

* reorganize the code to get a more logical structure
* use mkProgram instead of mkSimple, and briefly explain why
* add an application icon

### Work not yet complete:

[Get started](fsharp_get_started.md)
